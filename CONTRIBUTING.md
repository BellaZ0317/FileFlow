##contributing


There are lots of interesting, weird and inefficient things happening in this repo because I've literally been randomly building and fixing it over the past two years.

I love pythonic ways of doing things and I love seeing faster more efficient ways of doing things. So please feel free to throw your ideas at me.

Even PEP stylings are cool with me.

All I really want is some proof that it works, if travis likes it I'll probably take it : )
